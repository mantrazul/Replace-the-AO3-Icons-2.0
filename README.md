# AO3 Site Skin: Replace the AO3 Icons 2.0

Visit the [AO3 work](https://archiveofourown.org/works/57331222) for instructions. I also made a version for the [SquidgeWorld Archive](https://squidgeworld.org/works/71922)!

My theme for ao3 using this fork as base and [retrieveire](https://archiveofourown.org/users/retrieveire).
aaand these configuration via wizard:

- Background color:#fefbf7
- Text color:#794e05
- Header color:#cbb08d
- Accent color:#e3d4c2

(this preview is sloppy because at first I put it together so I had something to orient myself when changing the colors)

### Known Issues
- When author's use 'li' outside of the main text it will show up as Lucinda, I will fix this later but for now I just did a hotfix inside main texts.
